# LLM4Microwatt

This project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate hardware innovation by automatically generating RTL for architectural improvements in the open-source Microwatt CPU core. Our approach builds upon recent tools such as ChipChat and AutoChip, which generate RTL from natural language, and extends the concept to practical microarchitectural enhancements. This creates a bridge between AI-driven design and open hardware, enabling rapid prototyping and experimentation.
